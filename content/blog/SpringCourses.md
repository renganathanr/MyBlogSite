# Courses taken in Spring semester=> CGPA: 3.3
## 1. Introduction to Optimal Design=> Grade: B+
In this coursework, I learned the optimization techniques which will help to achieve better results in the real world problems. Techniques like Kuhn-Tucker method, Bisection method, Powell's method, Cubic search method, Golden Section method, Steepest Descent method, Fletcher Reeves method, Davidson-Fletcher-Powell method, Broydon-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method, Newton's method, Exterior Penalty Function method, Extended Interior Penalty Function method, Augmented Legrangian method, Sequential Linear Programming method, Method of Center, and Method of Feasible Directions are all learned through this coursework.

## 2. Advanced Engineering Mathematics=> Grade: A
This course structured into three parts. In the first part, I learned the topics like vector fields, line integrals, double integrals, and Stoke's theorem. In the second part, operations on complex numbers and in the third part operations on matrices are learned.

## 3. 3D Printing=> Grade: B-
In this coursework, the science and the mechanisms behind the various 3D printing process are learned. 3D printing processes like Material extrusion, Material jetting, Vat photopolymerization, and Powder bed fusion are learned. In the end, a project of designing an RC car using Fusion 360 and preparation of CAD files for 3D printing was done.

## 4. Independent CAD study=> Grade: A
In this coursework, I learned the parametric CAD workflow from the basic to the advanced level using Fusion 360. In the end, two CAD projects were done. First project is designing an existing CVD endcaps system which is difficult to use and the second one is designing a membrane holder which holds the nano-scale membrane undergoing various chemical tests.

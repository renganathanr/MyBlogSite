As a continuity of first week, I get into learning of making a dynamic website.
## Goal
The goal is to create a **basic todo web application**. For this, you need to have some basic understanding and knowledge of handling HTML and CSS, Python and its dependencies, Database application.
## Status
Right now, I learned how to use HTML without CSS to show some basic content in a browser with help of Python with one of its dependency **Flask.** I ran an app that shows the message typed inside the HTML template file.
## Result
In the end, I am able 
* to use basic HTML and CSS in the front end to render the content,
* to use Python with its dependencies as a mediator to communicate between the database and the server application,
* and to use the database in the backend to store and retrieve user information.

## Other learnings
1. My brother told me how to do things fast by mentioning the motto of Facebook=> **__Move Fast and Break Things__** which helps me to dodge away from getting stuck while writing my blogs and learning the new stuffs.
Also he told a story that emphasized the importance between quantity and quality.
    > **__Pottery making story__**  
**Long story short:** There was a teacher, two group of students each containing 15 heads, and a judge. The first group was assigned to make atleast 30 potteries (representing **Quantity**) within a day and the second group was assigned to make a single pot (representing **Quality**) with their utter creativity.
In the end, the works of the two group was tested for the best by the judge and the result was announced. The first group won the competetion with one of its pot.  
**Moral of the story:** $Practice helps a man move towards perfect$
2. Some incidents show me how to live a married life and what are the reasons that made conflicts between a couple.
    >**Long story short:** If you need something, then you work for it.

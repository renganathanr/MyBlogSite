This week I learned the basics of sqlite database with the help of a website named execute program and its link - [Basic working with SQLite](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/sql) and simultaneously created a basic todo webapp using a Youtube tutorial - [Learn Flask for Python - Full Tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA)
# SQLite learning process
The website uses a good strategy **(Spaced Repetition system)** to teach the required content and only 16 lessons are free. So it takes the whole week to progress through the free lessons.
# Basic todo webapp
It is a basic todo app that uses **Flask - a Python web framework** to communicate between the front elements and database and **SQLite** as a database. In this week I only make the webapp to perform its main purpose and I will add more features in the future. These are the steps I used to create the webapp.  
## Steps and checklists in them:  
1. Setup and workflow
    * Install Python and pip
    * Install virtualenv
    * Create our project directory (repo)
    * Create virtual environment inside the repo
    * Install required packages (flask, flask_sqlalchemy, gunicorn)
2. Get a basic app running
    * Create a python script that used Flask to display a basic message
3. Templates and static content
    * Create the basic templates and static contents to render your web app
4. Setting up and using Database (SQLite)
    * Add necessary codes in the python script to setting up and interact with the database
5. Create the basic todo app
    * Add the routes and necessary codes that do the required actions (saving and retrieving) to create a fully functional basic todo app
6. Deploy to Heroku
    * After tested the above app in the local machine, add Heroku credentials and create the app and push the files into the Heroku account.

 In this process, I faced many unknown terms in the Python code. Terms like classes, methods, and forms required a lot of extra understanding. For that I used W3Schools.com and GeeksforGeeks.com.
# Movies
**1. Paarai - Stone** - A Kollywood film which beautifully pictures the feelings inside of a truck driver's stone heart who faces the challenges for the cleaner's family after his unfortunate death.

**2. Mounam Pesiyadhe - How Silence Inside of a Man's Heart Speaks** - A Kollywood film which potrays the love comes into a youth's heart who has so hatred about love.

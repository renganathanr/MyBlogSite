As mentioned in the previous week, I learned the basics of sqlite database using the website and simultaneously created the basic todo webapp using the Youtube tutorial.
### **SQLite learning process**
The website uses a good strategy **(Spaced Repetition system)** to teach the required content and only 16 lessons are free. So it takes the whole week to progress through the free lessons.
>See previous weeknote for the site's link
### **Basic todo webapp**
These are the steps used in the tutorial.  
**Steps and checklists under those steps:**  
1. Setup and workflow
    * Install Python and pip
    * Install virtualenv
    * Create our project directory (repo)
    * Create virtual environment inside the repo
    * Install required packages (flask, flask_sqlalchemy, gunicorn)
2. Get a basic app running
    * Create a python script that used Flask to display a basic message
3. Templates and static content
    * Create the basic templates and static contents to render your web app
4. Setting up and using Database (SQLite)
    * Add necessary codes in the python script to setting up and interact with the database
5. Create the basic todo app
    * Add the routes and necessary codes that do the required actions (saving and retrieving) to create a fully functional basic todo app
6. Deploy to Heroku
    * After tested the above app in the local machine, add Heroku credentials and create the app and push the files into the Heroku account.
>Again, for the tutorial link refer the previous weeknote. In this process, I faced many unknown terms in the flask code. Terms like classes, methods, and forms required a lot of extra understanding. For that I used W3Schools.com and GeeksforGeeks.com.
### **Movies**
**1. Paarai - Stone** - A Kollywood film which beautifully pictures the feelings inside of a truck driver's stone heart who faces the challenges for the cleaner's family after his unfortunate death.  
**2. Mounam Pesiyadhe - Silent speaks** - A Kollywood film which potrays the love comes into a youth's heart who has so hatred about love.

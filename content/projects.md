**Design of CVD end caps and membrane holder (Apr 2020)**  
An altered design for existing CVD endcaps to make it easier to use and a new concept design of membrane holder
for nanobiotechnology applications were done using Fusion 360 on my independent study.

**Design of a RC car (Apr 2020)**  
Design of a RC car was done using Fusion 360 for the 3D printing process to implement CAD knowledge and to
learn the science and mechanical aspects behind different 3D printers.

**Design of a hybrid renewable energy microgrid (Dec 2019)**  
Design of a hybrid renewable energy microgrid for a hospital in Haiti was done using HOMER energy software. A
study and analysis of the inner workings of the software were done.
**Design of a Wind Power plant (Dec 2019)**  
A preliminary design of a wind power plant for RIT was done using different methods along with economic analysis
and environmental considerations.

**Design of a Photovoltaic system (Dec 2019)**  
Based on the requirement, design of a photovoltaic system for a homeowner in Rochester was done using TMY
2017 data, and a comparison was conducted using online PV watts calculator besides an economic analysis.

**Design of a complete gear-reduction system (Dec 2019)**  
A compound gear reduction system using helical gears to directly drive the wheels of an electric vehicle by an
electric motor is designed using KISS SOFT software.

**Design and Analysis of Horizontal Boiler Lug (Apr 2017)**  
Altered design of boiler to hang in the horizontal position using horizontal lug to save space occupied by the
vertical boiler lug; analysis was done by ANSYS.

**Design and Fabrication of hydraulic vice and jack (Apr 2016)**  
Designed an accessory to modify a hydraulic jack to perform as a jack when kept in a vertical position but switch
to a bench vice for holding objects when kept in a horizontal position.

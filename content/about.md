I am **Renganathan**, a graduate mechanical engineering student studying at Rochester Institute of Technology, New York, USA. I am from India. I love to live a natural life.

I learned this very lesson of sharing things with others all through my life.This blogging site is created in the aim of sharing the information which will be helpful for someone at some point. I am an amateur but interested in learning the computer science. I have the background of computer science back in my 11th and 12th grade. This site is a first step in the exploration and pursuit of my passion.

### **Hello everyone!**
It was a very good experience of creating my first theme that powers my Hugo blog site.

All credits goes to **Janne Kemppainen,** a software developer from Finland. He wrote a blog series about how to create a new Hugo theme in his site. https://www.pakstech.com/blog/introduction-to-hugo/

It was the root of this **Ananthi** theme (plant).
